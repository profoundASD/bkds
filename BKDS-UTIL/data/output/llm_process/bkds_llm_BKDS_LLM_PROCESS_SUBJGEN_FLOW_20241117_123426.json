It probably is a seedling of Rosa foetida and Rosa pimpinellifolia. The cultivar first bloomed at the suburban villa of George Folliott Harison, attorney, between 8th and 9th Avenues on 32nd Street, north of New York City. The site of Harison's villa is now just south of the present General Post Office. The nurseryman William Prince of Flushing, Long Island took cuttings and marketed the rose in 1830. 'Harison's Yellow' is naturalized at abandoned house sites through the west and is found as a feral rose along the Oregon Trail.\n'Harison's Yellow' was planted by the Heritage Rose Foundation in the Spring of 2009 near the grave of George Folliott Harison. The planting is now a part of the Heritage Rose District of NYC.\nThe cultivar has semi-double, clear yellow flowers with an average diameter of 5 to 6 centimetres (2.0 to 2.4 in), up to 25 petals, a slightly cupped bloom form, and a fruity fragrance. They appear in clusters in an early spring flush, lasting for three to four weeks.\n'Harison's Yellow' has prickles, small, greenish grey leaves with seven to nine leaflets, and develops many small, globular rose hips. The young hips are first green, then red, and turn to black in the ripe fruits, that reach an average diameter of 1.5 centimetres (0.59 in). The bushy shrub forms suckers on its own roots, and reaches a height and width of 1 to 1.75 metres (3.3 to 5.7 ft). The cultivar tolerates drought, shade and poorer soils, needs little care, and is very winter hardy \u2013 down to \u221235 \u00b0C (USDA zone 4). It can be planted solitary, in groups or as hedges.\n",

Known colloquially as \"yellow pine\" or \"long leaf yellow pine,\" this species is a prominent member of the pine family in the region, reaching impressive heights of 30\u201335 m (98\u2013115 ft) and diameters of 0.7 m (28 in). In the past, before extensive logging took its toll, longleaf pines were reported to grow even taller, with towering heights of up to 47 m (154 ft) and diameters of 1.2 m (47 in).\n\nHere are three key facts about the longleaf pine, particularly focusing on the Alabama - Southern Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustris):\n1. Cultural Symbolism: The longleaf pine holds profound cultural significance in the Southern United States, serving as the official state tree of Alabama. Revered for its resilience, beauty, and ecological importance, this iconic tree symbolizes the region's natural heritage and environmental stewardship efforts.\n2. Ecosystem Benefits: Longleaf pine forests are crucial ecosystems that support a diverse array of plant and animal species. The unique structure of longleaf pine forests, with their open understory and diverse plant communities, provides habitat for endangered species like the red-cockaded woodpecker and gopher tortoise, highlighting the ecological importance of these forests.\n3. Conservation Efforts: Due to historical logging practices and habitat loss, longleaf pine forests have faced significant declines over the years. Conservation initiatives and restoration efforts are underway to protect and restore these vital ecosystems, promoting the recovery of longleaf pine populations and the biodiversity they support.\n\nThe longleaf pine, with its towering presence and ecological significance, embodies the rich natural heritage and environmental importance of the Southeastern United States. As a keystone species in unique ecosystems, the longleaf pine serves as a testament to the resilience and beauty of native plant species, inspiring conservation efforts and fostering a deeper appreciation for the diverse flora that defines the Southern landscape.\n\n***original content below***\n\nThe longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) stands as a majestic pine species native to the Southeastern United States, gracing the coastal plain from East Texas to southern Virginia, with its presence extending into northern and central Florida. Known colloquially as \"yellow pine\" or \"long leaf yellow pine,\" this species is a prominent member of the pine family in the region, reaching impressive heights of 30\u201335 m (98\u2013115 ft) and diameters of 0.7 m (28 in). In the past, before extensive logging took its toll, longleaf pines were reported to grow even taller, with towering heights of up to 47 m (154 ft) and diameters of 1.2 m (47 in).\n\nHere are three key facts about the longleaf pine, particularly focusing on the Alabama - Southern Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustris):\n1. Cultural Symbolism: The longleaf pine holds profound cultural significance in the Southern United States, serving as the official state tree of Alabama. Revered for its resilience, beauty, and ecological importance, this iconic tree symbolizes the region's natural heritage and environmental stewardship efforts.\n2.
