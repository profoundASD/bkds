The Las Vegas Valley metropolitan area is the largest within the greater Mojave Desert, and second-largest in the Southwestern United States. Las Vegas is an internationally renowned major resort city, known primarily for its gambling, shopping, fine dining, entertainment, and nightlife, with most venues centered on downtown Las Vegas and more to the Las Vegas Strip just outside city limits. The Las Vegas Valley as a whole serves as the leading financial, commercial, and cultural center for Nevada. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had 641,903 residents in 2020, with a metropolitan population of 2,227,053, making it the 25th-most populous city in the United States.\nThe city bills itself as the Entertainment Capital of the World, and is famous for its luxurious and extremely large casino-hotels. With over 2.9 million visitors as of 2019, Las Vegas is the sixth-most visited city in the U.S., after New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, Orlando, and San Francisco. It is a top-three destination in the U.S. for business conventions and a global leader in the hospitality industry, claiming more AAA Five Diamond hotels than any other city in the world. Las Vegas annually ranks as one of the world's most visited tourist destinations. The city's tolerance for numerous forms of adult entertainment had earned it the nickname \"Sin City\", and has made Las Vegas a popular setting for literature, films, television programs, and music videos.\nLas Vegas was settled in 1905 and officially incorporated in 1911. At the close of the 20th century, it was the most populated North American city founded within that century (a similar distinction was earned by Chicago in the 19th century). Population growth has accelerated since the 1960s and into the 21st century, and between 1990 and 2000 the population nearly doubled, increasing by 85.2%. As with most major metropolitan areas, the name of the primary city (\"Las Vegas\" in this case) is often used to describe areas beyond official city limits. In the case of Las Vegas, this especially applies to the areas on and near the Strip, which are actually in the unincorporated communities of Paradise and Winchester. Over time and influenced by climate change, droughts in Southern Nevada, already one of the driest regions in the United States, have been increasing in frequency and severity, putting a further strain on Las Vegas's water security."

During its active years, the base played a crucial role in training and supporting heavy strategic bombing groups and wings, contributing to the country's defense strategy. Let's delve into some key facts about this historic Air Force base:\n\n1. **Strategic Air Command Hub:** Carswell Air Force Base served as a vital Strategic Air Command (SAC) base throughout the Cold War era. It housed several SAC intercontinental bombardment wings, operating cutting-edge heavy bombers such as the B-29 Superfortresses, B-36 Peacemakers, and B-52 Stratofortresses. The base's strategic location and advanced facilities made it a cornerstone of America's defense infrastructure.\n\n2. **Industrial Complex:** A notable feature of Carswell AFB was the presence of United States Air Force Plant 4 on the west side of the airfield. This sprawling 602-acre industrial complex was utilized by major aviation companies like Convair, General Dynamics, and Lockheed Martin over the years. It played a pivotal role in the production of iconic aircraft including the Convair B-36, B-58 Hustler, F-111 Aardvark, EF-111 Raven, and F-16 Fighting Falcon.\n\n3. **Transformation and Legacy:** Following the end of the Cold War, the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission of 1991 recommended the closure of Carswell AFB by 1994. Subsequently, the base underwent a transformation and is now known as Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth. It continues to host a diverse military presence, including Air Force Reserve units, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Army Aviation Reserve, and Air National Guard flying units that were previously stationed at Naval Air Station Dallas.\n\nExpanding our exploration to other significant Air Force bases, one cannot overlook the importance of **Little Rock Air Force Base**. Located in Arkansas, Little Rock AFB plays a crucial role in airlift operations, serving as the home of the C-130 Hercules training program. The base contributes significantly to the readiness and capabilities of the U.S. Air Force in executing airlift missions worldwide.\n\nIn conclusion, the legacy of Carswell Air Force Base stands as a testament to the dedication and service of the men and women who served there. Its transformation into Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth ensures that its historical significance is preserved while continuing to support the nation's defense needs.\r\n\r\n***original content below***\r\n\r\nCarswell Air Force Base is a former United States Air Force (USAF) base, located northwest of Fort Worth, Texas.  For most of its operational lifetime, the base's mission was to train and support heavy strategic bombing groups and wings.\nCarswell was a major Strategic Air Command (SAC) base during the Cold War.  It was the headquarters of several SAC intercontinental bombardment wings, equipped with the latest heavy bombers from B-29 Superfortresses; B-36 Peacemakers and B-52 Stratofortresses. The west side of the airfield was home to United States Air Force Plant 4, a 602-acre (2.44 km2) industrial complex occupied over the decades by Convair, General Dynamics, and now by Lockheed Martin. The bulk of the Air Force Convair B-36, B-58 Hustler, F-111 Aardvark, EF-111 Raven and F-16 Fighting Falcon fleets were built there.\nWith the end of the Cold War and the subsequent downsizing of the American military, the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission of 1991 recommended that Carswell AFB be closed by 1994.  Today, the facility is known as Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth.  It retains an Air Force Reserve presence as well hosting Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve Army Aviation Reserve and Air National Guard flying units which were formerly located at Naval Air Station Dallas."
